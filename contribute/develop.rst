About the policy about repository access
========================================

For the moment, I decided to give write access to my repository to nobody,
because I want to check everything that is pushed in it. If someone pushes a
bad update, it may be dangerous for users and I do not want that.

On the other side, I am **very** open to pull requests, that's to say, if you
ask me to merge some changes you made, there are 99% changes I will merge this
changes.
That's why I suggest you to fork my repository on GitHub, make your
modifications, and click the "Pull requests" button in my repository.

Using Git
=========

If you are a developer, I assume that you know how to use Git. If you don't,
I suggest you to learn how to use it, at least the basics (clone, checkout,
branch, commit, push/pull, add/rm, log, show, reset, revert).

I learnt how to use Git with an ebook, also available as a real book:
`Pro Git`_.

Our preferred way of contributing is through GitHub pull requests to
`Limnoria's repository`_. Please send your pull requests to the `testing`
branch.

Where to start
==============

If you are not an experienced Python and/or Limnoria developer, you
can start with solving `issues tagged as easy`_. I believe they are
likely to be easy to solve even without a lot of experience.

If you need help solving an issue (tagged as easy or not) or want
to find an issue that matches your skills, please ask on IRC, we will
be glad to help you.
