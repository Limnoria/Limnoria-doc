About the policy about repository access
========================================

For the moment, I decided to give write access to my repository to nobody,
because I want to check everything that is pushed in it. If someone pushes a
bad update, it may be dangerous for users and I do not want that.

On the other side, I am **very** open to pull requests, that's to say, if you
ask me to merge some changes you made, there are 99% changes I will merge this
changes.
That's why I suggest you to fork my repository on GitHub, make your
modifications, and click the "Pull requests" button in my repository.

Using Git
=========

If you are a developer, I assume that you know how to use Git. If you don't,
I suggest you to learn how to use it, at least the basics (clone, checkout,
branch, commit, push/pull, add/rm, log, show, reset, revert).

I learnt how to use Git with an ebook, also available as a real book:
`Pro Git`_.

Code style
==========

Read the doc in the source code (docs/STYLE.rst).
