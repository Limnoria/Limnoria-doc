Welcome to Limnoria's documentation!
====================================

Limnoria is a robust (it doesn't crash), user friendly (it's easy to
configure) and programmer friendly (plugins are *extremely* easy to write)
Python IRC bot.
It aims to be an adequate replacement for most existing IRC bots.
It includes a very flexible and powerful ACL system for controlling access
to commands, as well as more than 60 builtin plugins providing around 400
actual commands.

It is the successor of Supybot since 2010 and provides many new features,
but keeps full compatibility with existing configurations and plugins.
